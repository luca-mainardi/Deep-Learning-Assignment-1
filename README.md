# Assignment 1: Deep Learning (2AMM10)
This repository contains the first assignment for the Deep Learning course (2AMM10) at Eindhoven University of Technology, for the academic year 2023-2024. 
The assignment primarily focuses on metric learning with one-shot learning, particularly in the context of character recognition.

The key objectives and techniques covered in this assignment include:

-- Data loading and preprocessing: Efficient handling and preparation of character image data for model training.
- Metric Learning and One-Shot Learning: Implementation of one-shot learning techniques to recognize characters with minimal training examples.
- Triplet Networks: Utilization of triplet networks to learn a similarity metric, improving the model's ability to distinguish between different characters.
- Rotation Invariance: Techniques to add rotation invariance, enhancing the model's robustness to rotated character inputs.
- Domain Knowledge Integration: Incorporation of domain knowledge on character sequence probabilities to further improve recognition accuracy.
